# Node Basics

In node, we can't use some of the browser(another runtime for JS) functions. To list a few:

We can't use `alert` in `node.js`, while using an error related to undefined Object is thrown. Similarly, if we console.log `window` same error is thrown.

For getting information on node.js internals, we can console.log `global`, an alternative to window for node.js
